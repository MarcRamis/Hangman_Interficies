# Hangman_Interficies 🎮

## Introduction
**Hangman_Interficies** is a **2D Hangman game for Android** developed in **Unity (C#)**. The project was created to **enhance hard skills** by exploring various **design patterns, SDKs, APIs, and UI/UX concepts**. It integrates **Google Firebase** for cloud services and **Google Mobile Ads** for monetization.

This project aims to provide insights into **best practices** for game development, including architecture patterns, API consumption, HUD design, and performance optimization.

## Features ✨
- 🎨 **Interactive Graphical Interface** – Enhanced visuals with **TextMesh Pro**.
- 🎭 **MVVM Architecture** – Implements a **variant of MVVM** with **Presenter & Controller**.
- 📡 **Cloud Data Storage** – Uses **Google Firebase** for authentication and game data persistence.
- 💰 **Ad Monetization** – Integrated with **Google Mobile Ads** to generate revenue.
- 🔗 **API Integration** – Uses an external API to fetch words dynamically for the Hangman game.
- 🛠 **Design Patterns & Best Practices** – Uses **Services, Installers & Use Cases** for better code organization.
- ⏩ **DOTween Implementation** – Smooth animations and UI transitions.
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly HUD Design** – Properly designed & optimized **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** elements.
- 🧩 **Modular Code Structure** – Well-organized scripts and assets for maintainability.
- 🚀 **Reactive Programming** – Implements **UniRx**, similar to .NET Reactive Extensions, to manage event-based programming.
